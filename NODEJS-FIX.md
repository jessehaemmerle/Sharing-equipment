# ðŸ”§ Node.js Compatibility Fix Applied

## âœ… ISSUE RESOLVED

**Problem:** React Router DOM v7.5.1 requires Node.js 20+, but Dockerfiles were using Node.js 18.

**Solution Applied:**
- âœ… Updated `frontend/Dockerfile` to use `node:20-alpine`
- âœ… Updated `frontend/Dockerfile.nginx-proxy` to use `node:20-alpine`  
- âœ… Updated `frontend/Dockerfile.dev` to use `node:20-alpine`
- âœ… Added engine requirements to `package.json`
- âœ… Created `fix-nodejs.sh` script for quick fixes
- âœ… Updated documentation with troubleshooting guide

## ðŸš€ Ready to Deploy

Your VPS deployment should now work without Node.js compatibility errors:

```bash
# Upload to your VPS
scp -r toala-at/ user@your-vps-ip:~/

# SSH and deploy
ssh user@your-vps-ip
cd toala-at
./deploy-vps.sh
```

## ðŸ”§ If You Still Get Errors

Run the fix script before deployment:

```bash
# On your VPS
./fix-nodejs.sh
./deploy-vps.sh
```

## ðŸ“‹ What Changed

### Before:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as build
```

### After:
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine as build
```

### package.json Addition:
```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=20.0.0",
  "npm": ">=9.0.0"
}
```
